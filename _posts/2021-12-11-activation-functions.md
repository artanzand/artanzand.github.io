In this post I will be going over various activation functions to explain their use cases and where they would apply the best.

|	|ReLU|	Logistic| Sigmoid|	tanh|	
|-----|---------|----------|---------|-------|
Fast to compute?|	???	|NO|	NO|	YES|
|Simple derivative?|	???	|YES|	YES|	YES|
|Continuous?|	??|	YES|	YES|	NO|
|Region of uncertainty?|	NO|	YES|	YES|	YES|
|Directional derivative?|	NO|	YES|	YES|	YES|
