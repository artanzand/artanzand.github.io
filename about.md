I consider myself a self-motivated professional with over 7 years of data mining, cleansing and analysis, KPI and feature engineering, visualization of data insights, and data-driven business optimization. I am seeking opportunities to advance professional experience in relation to the consulting and data science industries. My strong passion and curiosity for machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and research related applications keeps me going every day.
