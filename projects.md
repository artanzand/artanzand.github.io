### Semantic Image Segmentation

---
In a second phase of my Neural Style Transfer (NST) project, I have applied semantic image segmentation to exclude person figures from the style transfer. This project deploys a U-Net deep learning architecture capable of separating person figures from their background. The image segmentation pipeline is then stacked on the NST pipeline to augment the output image.  

Tools used: Tensorflow, Google Cloud Platform, data augmentation, data loading and image preprocessing

### Neural Style Transfer

---
This is a personal project on implementation of Neural Style Transfer, an unsupervised machine learning model. The goal of this project was to read and understand a research paper ([Gatys et al. (2015)](<https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576>)) and implement a Tensorflow code that would run on a GPU-accelerated machine (an NVIDIA product). Skills learned also include image processing and transformation, Transfer Learning and building an NVIDIA docker image using [Podman](https://artanzand.github.io//Tensorflow-Docker/).

Tools used: Tensorflow, Keras, PIL, NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Podman, QEMU

### Canadian Heritage Funding

---
This is a group project on a classification problem demonstrating my teamwork performance and knowledge of Data Science workflows, Github Actions, creating Docker images and formulating a reproducible analysis, model, and report.

### COVID-19 Testing â€“ Online Booking Website

---
This is a proof-of-concept website designed at the beginning of the pandemic to reduce the pressure on Public Health call centers in Calgary, Alberta caused by higher than normal volumes related to COVID-19. The website serves three main purposes: Screening of the patients, booking a time for walk-in or drive thru testing appointments and storing the data in a SQL database, and modifying booked appointments.  

Languages used: Python, Flask, SQL, HTML, JavaScript, CSS
